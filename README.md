# java-refresher

A refresher on Java Syntax before my next project (which is coded in Java).

I am revisiting the concepts I learned previously in anticipation of my next project. Java was my first language, but it's been almost a year since I've used it.
I'm excited to see how much more I can grasp with the knowledge I have obtained from coding in other languages since then.
